## Part 1 - Active Learning Strategies

1. Select an active learning protocol to implement in your next class: Peer Instruction, Think-Pair-Share, Purposeful Question, Quick Write, Other...

2. Write a detailed description of how you will facilitate it, including
    - the concept question / prompt
    - timing of each element
    - precisely what students will be asked to do
    - how groups will be formed

3. Reflect on how it went
    - how did it feel to facilitate?
    - in what ways was it effective/ineffective?
