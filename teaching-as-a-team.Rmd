## Teaching Observation Debrief

### Goals
- Provide feedback from observed class
- Venue for discussion about teaching strategies

--
    
### Format
1. Spend 10 minutes discussing instructor 1's class session.
2. Spend 10 minutes discussing instructor 2's class session.

_Person with a longer first name will be instructor 1._

## Debrief Instructor 1

1. Instructor 1
    - What was your impression of the class? 
    - What were the strengths?
    - Where are you seeking suggestions for improvement?

--
2. Observer
    - What went well?
    - Constructive but gentle suggestions. "I noticed that ... I wonder if..."
    - Avoid bland general feedback. Focus on specific and actionable.
    - Share observation form
