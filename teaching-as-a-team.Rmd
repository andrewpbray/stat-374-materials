## Teaching Observation Debrief

### Goals
- Provide feedback from observed class
- Venue for discussion about teaching strategies

--
    
### Format
1. Spend 10 minutes discussing instructor 1's class session.
2. Spend 10 minutes discussing instructor 2's class session.

_Person with a longer first name will be instructor 1._

---
## Debrief Instructor 1

1. Instructor 1
    - What was your impression of the class? 
    - What were the strengths?
    - Where are you seeking suggestions for improvement?

--
2. Observer
    - What went well?
    - Constructive but gentle suggestions. "I noticed that ... I wonder if..."
    - Avoid bland general feedback. Focus on specific and actionable.
    - Share observation form
    
--

3. Discuss: Instructor takes notes on form

--

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 10, bottom = 0)
```

1. Instructor 2
    - What was your impression of the class? 
    - What were the strengths?
    - Where are you seeking suggestions for improvement?

--

    - What went well?
    - Constructive but gentle suggestions. "I noticed that ... I wonder if..."
    - Avoid bland general feedback. Focus on specific and actionable.

???

## Large group discussion questions
- As the teacher, what was the most useful part of this process for you?
- As the observer, what would you like to improve for next time?

---

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/observation-cycle.png")
```

---
## Last Step

## Break!

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5, bottom = 0, play_sound = TRUE)
```

# The Instructor Perspective

- "core and main engine of the course"
- "create quiz/exam questions"
- "in charge of leading section"
- "empathise with students"
- "instructors' eyes and ears"
- "timely, fair and accurate grading of problem sets"
- "My jobs are similar to yours except that I am giving lectures not lab sessions"
- No response (most common!)
