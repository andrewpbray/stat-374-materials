## Part I
Reflect back on the last class session that you taught. In a few sentences each, please describe:
- What went well?
- What went poorly?
- What is one thing you learned?

## Part II
Select and read at least one of the selections below from the book [Why Students Don't Like School](https://moodrmoo.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/why-dont-students-like-school.pdf).
- Why Do Students Remember Everything That's on Television and Forget Everything I Say? The Importance of Memory: p. 41 - 49
- How Thinking Works: p. 10 - 14
- Is Drilling Worth it? Practice Enables Further Learning: p. 81 - 87

Afterwards, please post to Ed your thoughts (a paragraph or two) on the reading selection. The questions below might be helpful to spur your thinking.

Possible questions to address:
1. Does this reading resonate with your own experience or contrast with it? In what ways?
2. What are a few critiques one would make of the arguments presented?
3. How do the ideas present inform how you might change your teaching?

In place of posting a new comment, you can also reply to your fellow students' comments. Any engagement and input is welcome as long as it's original and respectful.

To be clear, there are two components to this assignment. Submit Part I to this bCourses assignment, and "submit" Part II on Ed.
