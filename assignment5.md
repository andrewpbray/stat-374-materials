## Part 1 - Your role as a GSI
The topic for next class is "Teaching as a member of a team", so in preparation, please reflect on the role you play as a GSI in a paragraph for two for the question below. The second question is meant to be answered by your instructor, so please ask them either in person for a few sentences about how they see the role of the GSI in their class.

Note: if you know of other students in 375 that are also GSIing for the same class, coordinate your question so the instructor only has to answer once (and then send that answer around to your fellow GSIs).

Write your answer to 1 before hearing from the instructor's response in 2.
### 1. From the GSI
What do you think your role is as a GSI in the broader context of the course? What responsibilities do you have to your students? What responsibilities do you have towards your instructor?
### 2. From the Instructor
What do you see as the role of GSI in the broader context of the course? What responsibilities do they have to the students? What responsibilities do you have towards you?

Submit the above here on bCourses.

## Part 2 - Reading for the week
In addition, please read one of the following pieces and leave a comment on Ed:
- Pages 3-8, and 11-12 (you may skip "Quality Assurance") of [Working With Your TA](https://teaching.pitt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GSTI-Working-with-Your-TA.pdf). Graduate Student Teaching Initiative, University of Pittsburgh. Fourth Edition, 2018.
- [GSI Guide: Preparation and Management](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/gsis/current/prep). University of California, Berkeley, Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. If you choose this reading, you can stop at "Recommendations," and you may also skip "Teaching Resources."

It might make more sense for grad students to read the first option, and undergrads to read the second, but you are free to choose whichever one you want. After the reading, please post a comment (or reply to somebody else's comment) on Ed. Here are some guiding questions:
1. How might this piece affect your relationship with your instructor? Is there anything in particular that you realize should be improved? (e.g. setting boundaries, having clearer expectations, etc.)
2. What are some suggestions the piece offers that your course staff can take to improve the experience for both you (the GSI) and your students?
3. Have you experienced any of the challenging situations described in the piece? If so, how might you address such a situation if it arises again?
Finally, please also upload your teaching observation form to the bCourses assignment labeled "Teaching Observation Form Upload."
