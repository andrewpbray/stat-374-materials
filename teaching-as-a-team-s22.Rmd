# Teaching as a Team

## The Role of a GSI: The GSI Perspective

Beyond facilitating your section, several other roles emerged:

.pull-left[
**Point of contact**: Link between student and rest of course

**Content Creator**: Write lesson plans, questions, rubrics
]

.pull-right[
**Operations**: Course infrastructure, grading

**Inspirer**: Keep students engaged and motivated
]

> Decide which one of these you *most* identify with.


---
## Discuss

.task[
With your group, take turns sharing.

1. Your primary and secondary roles, as you understand them to be.

2. What two activities you spend the most time doing as part of your role.

3. Was there agreement or contrast in how your instructor views your role?

## The Good and the Bad

## Teaching as a Team

Consider one aspect of or incident in your working relationship with your teaching team that has gone _well_ and one that you'd like to _improve_.

1. Think: write a short description on a scratch piece of paper / notepad.
2. Pair: share your experience with a partner and discuss.
3. Share: whole class discussion.
