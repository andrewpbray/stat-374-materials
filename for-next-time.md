# Week 1 Welcome to Class
(see issue)


# Three models of pedagogy

# Motivation

- Willingham's bit about content doesn't matter - good questions do
- implicit vs explicit motivation
- See Hunn week 6



# Guiding Attention and Memory

Prep reading: both "How thinking works"" and "The importance of memory"" from "Why students don't like school"


# Designing a Lesson Plan

- They submit a lesson plan beforehand.
- In class we review a few lesson planning formats then in pairs they take turns sharing their lesson plan and helping fill out the 5E Lesson Plan
- Share out: What was the biggest gap in your preparation / lesson plan?
- Change reading over to kimerly tanner 2010: order matters

# Resources to scan for next time for overall structure
- https://gsi.berkeley.edu/media/Learning-Theory-and-Research.pdf
    - has nice overview of 3 main theories of education (behaviorist, constructivist, social constructivist) and several good motivation references.
        - have students read short descriptions of each theory beforehand than in class and put reflections up on Ed. in class we review each theory on board/slides, share some opinions, then do an activity where each group gets an example of a assessment or lesson structure used in stats / data science (or the data 8 syllabus?) and is asked to classify it according to the three theories. Afterwards we share out what people thought.


# Teaching as a team
- As part of previous assignment, have student contribute an anonymous comment about something that has gone well and something that could be improved when working with an instructor.
- Develop "contract" between instructor and GSI. Distribute at first Welcome to Class meeting.

# One on ones
- Useful but move to earlier in the semester.
- Grad questions:
    - what class are you teaching
    - walk me through a week in the life of a student in that course
    - what was your section like this week?
    - what are your bigggest challenges?
    - what has been most useful about 375
- Ugrad questions:
    - do you plan on staying for course staff?
    - are you interested in 20 hr role? why or why not?

# Tutoring session
- add a session on how to answer a question.
   - role playing
   - borrow from chris hunn's material
