## Teaching Observation Debrief

### Goals
- Provide feedback from observed class
- Venue for discussion about teaching strategies

--
    
### Format
1. Spend 10 minutes discussing instructor 1's class session.
2. Spend 10 minutes discussing instructor 2's class session.

_Person with a longer first name will be instructor 1._

---
## Debrief Instructor 1

1. Instructor 1

    - What was your impression of the class? 
    - What were the strengths?
    - Where are you seeking suggestions for improvement?

--
2. Observer
    - What went well?
    - Constructive but gentle suggestions. "I noticed that ... I wonder if..."
    - Avoid bland general feedback. Focus on specific and actionable.
    - Share observation form
    
--

3. Discuss: Instructor takes notes on form

--

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 10, bottom = 0)
```

## Debrief Instructor 2

1. Instructor 2

    - What was your impression of the class? 
    - What were the strengths?
    - Where are you seeking suggestions for improvement?

--
2. Observer
    - What went well?
    - Constructive but gentle suggestions. "I noticed that ... I wonder if..."
    - Avoid bland general feedback. Focus on specific and actionable.
    - Share observation form

3. Discuss: Instructor takes notes on form

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 10, bottom = 0)
```

---
???

## Large group discussion questions
- As the teacher, what was the most useful part of this process for you?
- As the observer, what would you like to improve for next time?

---

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/observation-cycle.png")
```

---
## Last Step

- Take your observation form with notes and type up reflection as part of next assignment to be posted to bCourses.

--

## Break!

When you return, please sit next to people who teach a _different_ sort of class than you.

countdown(minutes = 5, bottom = 0, play_sound = TRUE)

# Teaching as a Team

---
## The Role of a GSI: The GSI Perspective

Beyond facilitating your section, several other roles emerged:

.pull-left[
**Point of contact**: Link between student and rest of course

**Content Creator**: Write lesson plans, questions, rubrics
]

.pull-right[
**Operations**: Course infrastructure, grading

**Inspirer**: Keep students engaged and motivated
]

.task[
Decide which one of these you *most* identify with.
]

---
## Discuss

Find 2-3 other people who tend to view their roles **differently** and take turns sharing.

1. Your primary and secondary roles, as you understand them to be.

2. What two activities you spend the most time doing as part of your role.

3. Was there agreement or contrast in how your instructor views your role?
