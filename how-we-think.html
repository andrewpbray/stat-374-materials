#Course Structure

---
## New space, smaller classes

**Undergraduates**: Meet in Evans 330

**Graduates**: Meet in Evans 340

Same content, same Ed, different facilitator. Class will be 1.5 - 2 hours.

---
## Grading

This course is P/NP. A passing grade indicates that you have

1. attended class regularly, 
2. submitted weekly assignments, and 
3. joined in two sets of teaching observations.

--

We will look over your assignments each week and indicate ‚úîÔ∏è, ‚úîÔ∏è+, ‚úîÔ∏è-.

--

Mid-semester, we will schedule short one-on-one meetings to discuss how your teaching is going.


---
## Platforms

**Ed**: Course communication, discussion assignments

--

**bCourses**: Posting assignments, submitting assigments, readings

--

**Course website**: stat375.netlify.app contains materials (perpetually under construction).


---
## Community Standards

Status update

**Attention** determines which aspects of our environment enter short term memory.

things that might come up for students:
- sources of distraction
- "boredom" - content too easy or too hard
- focusing on other events in life

things that might come up for teachers:
- tangents, drifting away from learning goals
- (fear of) loss of credibility by students

# Siege of Breda

The siege of Breda of 1624‚Äì25 occurred during the Eighty Years' War. The siege resulted in Breda, a Dutch fortified city, falling into the control of the Army of Flanders.

Following the orders of Ambrogio Spinola, Philip IV's army laid siege to Breda in August 1624. The siege was contrary to the wishes of Philip IV's government because of the already excessive burdens of the concurrent Eighty and Thirty Years' wars. The strategically located city was heavily fortified and strongly defended by a large and well prepared garrison of 7,000 men, that the Dutch were confident would hold out long enough to wear down besiegers while awaiting a relief force to disrupt the siege.

.cite[Source: Wikipedia]

# Siege of Breda, cont.

Yet despite the Spanish government's opposition to major sieges in the Low Countries and the obstacles confronting any attack on such a strongly fortified and defended city, Spinola launched his Breda campaign, rapidly blocking the city's defences and driving off a Dutch relief army under the leadership of Maurice of Nassau that had attempted to cut off the Spanish army's access to supplies. 

The siege of Breda is considered Spinola's greatest success and one of Spain's last major victories in the Eighty Years' War. The siege was part of a plan to isolate the Republic from its hinterland, and co-ordinated with Olivare's naval war spearheaded by the Dunkirkers, to economically choke the Dutch Republic. Although political infighting hindered Spinola's freedom of movement, Spain's efforts in the Netherlands continued thereafter.

# Curating Attention

Some tips:

1. Visuals tend to override audio.
1. What you omit is as important as what you include.
1. Pick 1-3 take-homes and check that everything students see/hear ties back to them.

Did you read this slide or listen to it being read?

## Working Memory

**Working Memory** holds the information - from the environment and from long term memory - that that you can actively think about. Site of consciousness and awareness.

--

**Chunking** is the process of compressing several bits of information into a single bit.

## Group Discussion

.task[
With your group, come up with a list of **5 strategies** that help students chunk the information to make more room in working memory.
